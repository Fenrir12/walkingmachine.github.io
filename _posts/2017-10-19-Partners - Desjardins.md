## Desjardins
Desjardins Group is the largest cooperative financial group in Canada and has existed for more than a century! Each Caisse is a financial services cooperative that serves its members and protects their interests.

Every day, more than 300 Caisses in Quebec and Ontario serve the 7 million clients and members of the movement.

In addition to retail banking, Desjardins offers business services, wealth management and insurance products for both people and property.

We wanted to thank Caisse Desjardins South-West of Montr√©al who decided to award a grant to support our project. All these donations allow us to finance part of our expenses, both for the equipment and for the trips for the competitions.
